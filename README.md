# 👨‍🏭 Dev

A development toolkit for building Caido plugins. This CLI tool simplifies the process of developing, building, and packaging Caido plugins.

## 🏎️ Installation

```bash
pnpm install -D @caido-community/dev
```

You can then access the binary via `caido-dev`. If you installed it local to your package, it can be run using `pnpm exec caido-dev`.

## 📟 CLI Commands

### Build

```bash
caido-dev build [path] [--config <path-to-config>]
```

- **Description**: Build the Caido plugin.
- **Options**:
  - `-c, --config <path>`: Path to the `caido.config.ts` file.

### Watch

```bash
caido-dev watch [path] [--config <path-to-config>]
```

- **Description**: Start the development server and watch for changes.
- **Options**:
  - `-c, --config <path>`: Path to the `caido.config.ts` file.

## README Assets

Plugin packages always include the root `README.md`. Local README images are converted to compressed WebP data URIs during packaging, with each image limited to about 125 KiB and the final README limited to about 2 MiB. External `http` and `https` URLs are removed from README links and images, while `data:` URIs and fragment links are preserved.
